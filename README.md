The idea behind this is to connect with people during times of emergency involving shortage of blood. This app helps the hospital to notify people in that vicinity with the matching blood group to that of the required blood. This helps in efficiency as well as time management and prevent chaos during times of emergency. It also helps by connecting with the nearby hospital to check their blood bank and to communicate with them the dire necessity of that blood group.
